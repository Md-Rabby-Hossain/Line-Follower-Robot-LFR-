# Line Following Robot (LFR) - PCB Project

Welcome to our Line Following Robot (LFR) project repository!  
This repo contains the PCB design files, etching process details, and related resources for the custom PCB we built as part of our LFR project.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design, etch, and assemble a custom PCB for a Line Following Robot. This robot can detect and follow a black line on a white surface using IR sensors, controlled by a microcontroller.

## ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Included

- **PCB Design Files** 
- **Gerber Files**
- **Etching Process Images**
- **Component List**
